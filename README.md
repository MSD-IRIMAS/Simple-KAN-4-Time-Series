# KAN it be used for Time Series Classification ?

author : [Ali Ismail-Fawaz](https://hadifawaz1999.github.io/) - [@hadifawaz1999](https://github.com/hadifawaz1999)

In this repository, we present a feature-based Time Series Classifier based on [Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KANs)](https://github.com/KindXiaoming/pykan) proposed by [Liu et al. 2024 [1]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19756).
Given that a KAN model is still a fully connected network, it will not be able to detect temporal dependencies on time series data, however it will be able to work on extracted features from these series.
In this repository, we present a classifier based on extracting the Catch22 features [Lubba et al. 2019 [2]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10618-019-00647-x) followed by KAN classifier.
In order to showcase the performance of KAN, we compare it to using a softmax classifier on top of the Catch22 features.
The model of course can work with any type of transformation on time series data, we chose Catch22 for simpliciy.
We use the [aeon](https://github.com/aeon-toolkit/aeon) python package for the feature extraction part.

## Datasets

In this repository we utilize the amazing publicly available [UCR archive](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/%7Eeamonn/time_series_data_2018/) by [Dau et al. 2019 [3]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8894743/), the largest repository of unvariate Time Series Classification datasets.
Make sure to download the datasets and extract the zip folder.

## Docker image

If you are familiar with docker, simply build the image using the dockerfile provided as follows:

```docker build -t kan-ts-image .```

Following the image being built, create your docker container and mount the UCR archive datasets into the `/home/myuser/ucr_archive` directory and your current working directory to `/home/myuser/code` directory, as follows:

```docker run --gpus all -it --name kan-ts-container -v "$(pwd):/home/myuser/code" -v "/path/to/ucr/archiev/on/your/machine/:/home/myuser/ucr_archive/" --user $(id -u):$(id -g) kan-ts-image bash```

Make sure to replace `/path/to/ucr/archiev/on/your/machine/` by the directory on your local machine.

## Requirements

```
torch==2.2.1
numpy==1.24.4
pandas==2.0.3
scikit-learn==1.1.3
matplotlib==3.6.2
aeon==0.8.1
hydra-core --upgrade
omegaconf
black==23.11.0
pykan
setuptools==65.5.0
sympy==1.11.1
tqdm==4.66.2
pycatch22
```

## Code Usage

This code uses hydra for the parameters configuration, so simply edit the `config/config_hydra.yaml` file and run the following command:

```python3 main.py```

## Results

The code will generate per dataset a directory containing a csv file, with four columns, accuracy meand and std over five runs on both Catch22+KAN classifier and Catch22+softmax classifier.

Examples of some UCR datasets where KAN improves the classification performance:

| Dataset              | Test Accuracy with KAN | Test Accuracy with softmax |
| :------------------- | :--------------------: | -------------------------: |
| Chinatown            |         85.13 %        |           62.09 %          |
| ItalyPowerDemand     |         91.29 %        |           82.41 %          |
| ECG200               |         78.60 %        |           75.00 %          |
| ArrowHead            |         67.99 %        |           63.42 %          |
